On a dark and stormy night in October of 1983, Jason a 20 year old student at the University of Oregon was walking through the Chippawa woods where he and his friends had gone camping for the weekend. They were three days into their trip when Jason, groggy and hungover, wandered away from their camp to pee. As he stumbled back to the camp the lightning cracked overhead, and the wind russled the leaves on the ground. The hair on back of Jason's neck stood up. He could feel the eyes, jealously, angerily, tracking his every movement. He whirled around prepared to confront the sensation, and then he heard the scream.
